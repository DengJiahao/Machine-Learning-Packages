# Machine-Learning-Packages

This repository will contain tutorials about most fundamental machine learning algorithms and packages.

*@About me:*
I am a student majoring Financial Engineering. I am seeking a career in the field of quantitative finance.

*@About this repository:*
In 2015, I started to take MOOC courses specialized in Data Science. I took courses some of the most recommended courses: Andrew's Machine Learning, Machine Learning Specialization from University of Washington, and Data Science with Spark from UC Berkeley. Undoubtably they were beneficial, and helped me a lot both academically and professionally. However, I haven't got a chance to futher apply skills and knowledge learned from these courses, and they quickly fade out.

So I decided to create some tutorials on machine learning algorithms and packages. I decided to use Jupyter Notebook to write my tutorical because it is very friendly to a starter. I hope doing so will help me refresh basic machine learning theories and be prepared for an tech interview for my futher career.

From the first stage, I will cover the following machine learning algorithms:

- [x] regression
- [x] classification
- [x] clustering

I will use [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org) first, and hopefully will cover [tensor flow](https://www.tensorflow.org) [pySpark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/pyspark.html) in the futher.
