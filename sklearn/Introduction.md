## Introduction

This tutorial will be built based on the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) documentation and the slides from courses I've taken.

I will try to cover the following parts:
- [x] regression
- [x] classification
- [x] clustering
- [x] dimensionality reduction
- [x] model selection
- [x] preprocessing
